    Sometimes you get an URL by a user that just isn't a real
    URL because it contains unsafe characters like ' ' and so on.  This
    function can fix some of the problems in a similar way browsers
    handle data entered by the user:

    :param charset: The target charset for the URL if the url was
                    given as unicode string.
