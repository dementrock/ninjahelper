Ninja Helper
============

This is a helper web service for ninjacourses. It is currently under construction. We plan to implement the following features:

Course Monitor
--------------

Monitor a certain course whose waitlist is full. If the status changes we will send a message to your cell phone.

More Convenient Login
---------------------

Now when you type in username and password in the index page, we will automatically import your courses, friends, and return the comparison result. Technically you are not really "logged in". We will implement the authentication system.


Add My Schedule To Google Calender
----------------------------------

Well this is self explanatory :)
