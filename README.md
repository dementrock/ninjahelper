Ninja Helper
============

This is a helper web service for ninjacourses. It is currently under construction. We plan to implement the following features:

Waitlist Monitor
--------------

Monitor a certain course whose waitlist is full. If the status changes we will send a message to your cell phone.

Already implemented.

More Convenient Login
---------------------

Now when you type in username and password in the index page, we will automatically import your courses, friends, and return the comparison result. Technically you are not really "logged in". We will implement the authentication system.

Already implemented.

Safer Password Storage
----------------------

We haven't included any password encryption in the database yet. So using the website may have potential risks. We will add a revertible encryption process.

Add My Schedule To Google Calender
----------------------------------

Well this is self explanatory :)

Course Shortlink
----------------

Provide a custom shortlink for each course, e.g. http://www.ninjahelper.com/math53 --> http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/53f11/.

Already implemented.

Course Page Monitor
-------------------

Monitor the webpage of the course and send an email notification if any thing changes.
